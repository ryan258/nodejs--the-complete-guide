## Get a server running

- require the `http` module
- create a server var `http.createServer(res)` that responds to every request
- NodeJS relies heavily on event driven architecture (if x happens do y)
- run `$ node app.js` to start the server
- get server listening `server.listen(<portNumber>)`

Once you have your server going, it's just time to start doing something meaningful with it.
